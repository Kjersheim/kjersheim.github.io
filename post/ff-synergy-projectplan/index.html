<strong>Removing names for privacy, but keeping the roles to show the team.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Team Leader:</strong> Andreas Kjersheim</p>
<p><strong>Operations Lead:</strong></p>
<p><strong>General, Assisting in Coordination and Administration:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Security Lead, Manager Administrations:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tester Lead:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Development Lead:</strong></p>
<p>The project&rsquo;s focal point is the collaboration with the customer, customer . Under the guidance of Scrum Masters from the customer company  initially assigned the project &ldquo;Tukko&rdquo; to Team IoTitude in WIMMA Lab 2023. This project marks the continuation of collaboration between the customer company and JAMK University of Applied Sciences, resulting in a new assignment for future Tukko implementations.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the project is to evolve &ldquo;Tukko,&rdquo; specifically targeting the creation of &ldquo;Tukko v1.1.&rdquo; Tukko serves as a traffic visualizer web application, built as a framework comprising modules utilizing various technologies including React, MongoDB, TypeScript, Redis, Express.js, Node.js, REST API, and VITE. Its primary function is to streamline and enhance data from the digitraffic API, unifying scattered information into a more user-friendly interface. The tool also collects and stores long-term data for anomaly detection.</p>
<p>Development for Tukko follows industry best practices with a strict adherence to Typescript and ESLint rulesets. Despite being a complete product, there are numerous unexplored ideas due to project time constraints.</p>
<p>The project&rsquo;s methodologies include Agile principles, with Scrum as the chosen framework. Tools such as Gitlab and the OPF-framework serve as the backbone for all project documentation.</p>
<p>The project also encompasses educational elements, ensuring that team members possess the necessary skills and knowledge for their roles, including familiarity with Git, Linux basics, project management concepts, requirements definition, Agile development principles, programming languages like Python and JavaScript, and networking fundamentals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the project outlines specific milestones and deliverables, with defined criteria for Gate reviews to ensure project progress and quality. This assignment not only involves software development but also emphasizes effective documentation, customer communication, and testing.</p>
<p>To facilitate project management and tracking, the project adheres to a structured sprint-based schedule, divided into 8 sprints from Sprint00 to Sprint07, each lasting 2 weeks. As a student project, the main course have certain phases from Phase0 to Phase3, each with its distinct objectives and tasks. As major Milestones in our schedule, we are using gates throughout our development, ranging from GATE0 to GATE4. The ultimate aim is continuous improvement and the successful development of Tukko v1.1, aligning with the goals of customer Finland&rsquo;s assignment.</p>
<p>Please refer to the subsequent sections for a comprehensive breakdown of the project&rsquo;s details, goals, and timelines.</p>
<h3 id="12-goals-and-tasks">1.2 Goals and Tasks</h3>
<p>This section provides an in-depth understanding of the goals and tasks set for the &ldquo;Synergy - FF2024&rdquo; project, encompassing its background, objectives, resources, organization, and vision.</p>
<h3 id="121-background">1.2.1 Background</h3>
<p>The project centers around the enhancement and evolution of the existing &ldquo;Tukko&rdquo; traffic visualizer web application. This initiative stems from customer Finland&rsquo;s initial assignment in WIMMA Lab 2023, where Team IoTitude developed Tukko v1.0. Building upon this foundation, our team, Synergy, is tasked with creating &ldquo;Tukko v1.1.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="122-objectives">1.2.2 Objectives</h3>
<p>The primary objective is to create Tukko v1.1, a comprehensive and improved version of the traffic visualizer web application. This new iteration aims to excel in various aspects, including:</p>
<p><ins>User Interface and Accessibility (Epic 01):</ins> Enhance the user interface for improved accessibility and usability.</p>
<p><ins>Data Analysis and Export (Epic 02):</ins> Improve data analysis capabilities and data export features.</p>
<p><ins>Nordic Scalability (Epic 03):</ins> Ensure the application&rsquo;s scalability to cater to a broader Nordic audience.</p>
