comparing interfaces to the adapters on the virtual machine. Updating logical and physical topology. 


Adding ip-addresses to interfaces:

Since I dont have any VLANS within the two new subnets, I set the ip address directly on the interfaces and not adding the vif option. 

&#39; set interfaces ethernet eth3 address 10.8.83.246/30
  set interfaces ethernet eth0 address 10.8.83.250/30 
  commit
  save &#39;
</code></pre><p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/RouterCAddresses.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Eventually I check the addresses and add them to each interface eth0 and eth3.</p>
<p>I chose to delete the previous established static routes that were cloned from the original router. Not sure if this was neccesary if we are adding dynamic routing, but I think they would nomatter be wrong.</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/DeletingRoutes.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally I check the configuration of the new interfaces on Vyos Router A and B, and add them to the topologies.</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/NewCablesRouterAB.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From this I start a test pinging between routers.</p>

<h1 id="addressing-loopback-interfaces">Addressing loopback interfaces</h1>
<p>Initially I am trying to understand where the loopback lo would belong within the OSI model. As seen below, the loopback interface is linked to a certain ip-address, so in that sense I assume its a part of
the network layer 3. However doing some searches on the matter, I find answers also describing that there isnt a clean separation of the two TCP and IP-stacks.  Having these working on multiple elements of
the network layer, the transportation layer and also the session layer. Furthermore, loopback processing might also be done in a separate device driver that for the OS looks like any other device, and possibly even be looked
at as a part of the physical layer? Several answers describe it in the way that the OSI model might be used for describing the protocols themselves, but when it comes to ths structure of the network code its harder to place it in a singular location of the model.</p>
<h2 id="describing-the-subnets-to-use">Describing the subnets to use</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;parent&#34; subnet:
10.08.83.252/30
</code></pre><p>Approaching this made me need to step back to have a look on previous made subnets and the lessons I have learned so far. We could say that the /30 or /32 does not refer to the size of the
subnet, but rather the range within. Thinking like this makes more sense, but still does not explain the regular information we have about subnets so far.
Quite clearly there is no room for a subnet- or broadcastaddress within. /32 would have a subnet-mask of 255.255.255.255, and would only contain one single host.
From some research I find that these are used for specific purposes, as loopback interfaces or a &ldquo;host route&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On my Vyos Router A I can see that 127.0.0.1 is refered to as link/loopback:</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/routeripaddress.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Previously I am familiar with this address described as &ldquo;localhost&rdquo;, or the machine itself. Doing a quick search also shows the description that
the loopback address refers to the fact that no data packet addressed to 127.0.0.1 should leave the computer/host,
and sending it the packet gets &ldquo;looped back&rdquo; to on itself, so the sender becomes the recipient.</p>
<p>For example, previously we used an extension on Vistual Studio Code to host a webserver locally, on 127.0.0.1 :5500.</p>
<p>RFC1122 refers to the address 127.0.0.1 as a internal host loopback address, and no other addresses of this form must appear outside the host.
Routers that pick up traffic from the address are supposed to drop the packets immidiately. Whilst trying to focus on the framework of the assignment,
it is curious to consider the use/purpose/plan for the rest of the addresses within 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255, where the whole block is reserved.</p>
<p>Continuing on the exercise I believe the subnet mentioned above can be divided. Since I need three of the total 4 addresses avaliable, Ill describe those.</p>
<ul>
<li>10.8.83.253/32 - Vyos Router A</li>
<li>10.8.83.254/32 - Vyos Router B</li>
<li>10.8.83.255/32 - Vyos Router C</li>

<h1 id="configuring-ospf-on-the-routers">Configuring OSPF on the routers</h1>
<p>Initially I delete the old static routes from router A and B. Previously I already deleted them on the cloned router C, when changing its configurations.</p>
<p>I continue setting the router-id manually to the loopback interfaces I previously added, on all 3 devices and using the addresses referred to above:</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/settingrouterid.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At this point I needed to take a step back, trying to figure out which exact subnets to add as ospf to within each router.
Initially I only added the two subnets each router was connected to - between themselves. Completely forgetting the other workstation-groups, switches and loopback interfaces.
I then realized that is not going to be enough, as they wont magically transfer the ospf further out in the area.</p>
<p><strong>The commands used at this point was set protocols ospf area 0 network -subnet-address-</strong></p>
<p>For each router, I add the loopback interface I previously set to them. In addition to that I kept the two subnets I already added to each router.
Lastly I added the subnets that router A and Router B was connected to, and that I had not yet added.</p>
<p>So Router A would be a main point, connected to the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/VyosRouterAospf1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>at this point I was wondering about the &ldquo;greetings&rdquo; between adjacent devices. As depicted in the picture below, both router A and router B will be
sending information about the subnet .240/30. Is this somehow going to affect any processes in the routing?</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/Question1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In other words, if only router A is sharing information about the subnet between router A and B, it will still be known in the network topology, or vice verca if only router B is sharing its information.
Furhtermore, I was thinking what if a router would be disconnected or having issues, would it be beneficial of that subnet then to have another &ldquo;broadcaster&rdquo;? Then again, if router A goes down, the subnet between router A and B have little to no function.
The end question I guess would be if it is an issue that two routers are sharing the information, if it would get duplicated somehow. Yet to find an answer to this, as I decide to add all subnets connected to each router.</p>

<h1 id="verifying-connectivity">Verifying connectivity</h1>
<p>From the show ip commands printed above, and preliminary ping testing, devices on the network are identified and can reach eachother. To ensure all devices are online and also checking routes, I perform some tests with ping and traceroute.</p>
<p>A request from Lubuntu1 to Lubuntu3 is sent towards router A, which is the gateway in Lubuntu1s subnet. From there it continues to router B, which is the gateway for Lubuntu3s subnet. Last stretch is straight to Lubuntu3.</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/RouterL1L3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next I check the route between Lubuntu1 and Router C. First it goes directly, to A then C. If I then chose the address to router C, but in the subnet between Router C and B - it goes via Router B.</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/tracerouteL1RouterC.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="reference-bandwidth">Reference-bandwidth</h3>
<p>At this point I also change the reference bandwidth to cost value in all 3 routers.</p>
<p>set protocols ospf auto-cost reference-bandwidth 1000</p>
<p>Setting it up from 100 to 1000 Mbit/sec. Committing, saving and restarting the routers.
Despite not expecting to see any changes, as I cant see any way to imitate a cost difference on the virtual network as of this point,
I still want to set it up due to having gigabit ethernet lines on my &ldquo;physical plan&rdquo; in E06.</p>
<p>I do another test just to ensure there are no changes, and the routes described in the above picture depicting the route between Lubuntu1 and RouterC remains the same.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I did consider incrasing it even more, this due to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ethernet description   &ndash; Reference bandwidth / default bandwidth = cost</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gigabit ethernet 1 Gbps &ndash; 1 000 000 000 / 1 000 000 000 = 1</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>10 Gigabit ethernet 10 Gbps &ndash; 1 000 000 000 / 10 000 000 000 = 1</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fast ethernet 100Mbps &ndash; 1 000 000 000 / 100 000 000 = 10</p></blockquote>
<p>As seen, even with 1000 Mbps reference, 1 and 10 Gbps would be given the same cost.</p>
<p>Increasing the reference-bandwidthto 10 000 then could solve this, but for now I leave it at 1000 as my net is not have that fast infrastructure yet,
and that the network devices and cabling would be well within and below 1 Gbps in most areas, except between the main devices which are planned with the 1Gbps lines.</p>
<h3 id="connectivity-and-analysis-continues">Connectivity and analysis continues</h3>
<p>I remember from the materials to be wary of the SPF execution count. By doing a check on all three routers, I find the SPF algoritmn has run 19, 14 and 11 times on A, B and C. I cant really tell how this is counted, but I assume it
has to do with changes in the network - and perhabs also at a certain time to make sure it gets the new information. I am yet to fully delve into the different parts of the packet exchange between the routers, but</p>
<blockquote>
<p>show ip ospf database</p></blockquote>
<p>Previously I ran the abovementioned ospf data command, which shows that all 3 routers are visible in this main(and at the moment only) area, the backbone.
It also shows how many links each router has, still within the area. Router A, as we know but also as seen with the command, with 6 links as situated quite in the middle and being connected to more subnets than the others.</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/databaseroutera.png" alt=""></p>
<blockquote>
<p>show ip ospf neighbour</p></blockquote>
<p>From the information about how the routers sees its neighbours, we can tell that:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Router A perspective, RouterB and RouterC is the designated router.</li>
<li>For Router B, Router A is the backup and C the designated router.</li>
<li>For Router C, both router A and B is the backup.</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point in my testing, the database changed. I am still unaware of why. But previously, both which routers was backup or DR were different.
If this came to be due to the change in reference-bandwidth for costs, is not clear to me yet. From what I understand previously, the change of priority in each router would be
the change that could manually set which router would have which role - much like we did in a previous exercise. For ospf I find the command &lsquo;ip ospf priority x&rsquo; - although I have not used that on my own network.</p>
<p>From the list above, I do find it peculiar. In my mind it would be natural that a certain router logically connected would be the designated router. For example - for Router A I would feel its more natural that router B is DR and router C is backup.</p>
<p>The rules I find describe the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Router is highest OSPF priority will become DR and router with second-highest priority will become BDR.</li>
<li>If the priority of the routers are same then, the router with the highest Router ID is selected as DR and the router with second-highest Router ID is selected as BDR.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p>If then looking at the router ID that I set manually earlier,
Router B with address/ID 10.8.83.254, which in decimal equals to 168317950
Router C with address/ID 10.8.83.255, which in decimal equals to 168317951</p>
<p>According to this, it should be router C that is set as designated router, and B as backup. However - if looking at a traceroute between Lubuntu3 and Lubuntu1, it chose the route straight from B to A.</p>

<p>The routes are shown as selected with the marker &lsquo;&gt;&rsquo; and either Connected as mentioned above, or O for ospf.</p>

From there - packets can move through to subnet .244/30</p>
<p>I could add more traceroutes around, but I feel its working quite well and from what I have seen so far I am satisfied with the result and connectivity as each devices reach around the network.</p>

<h1 id="ospf-router-security">OSPF router security</h1>
<h1 id="passive-interfaces">Passive interfaces</h1>
<p>While adding the passive-interfaces I found that I had an error in my physical topology. The logical was correct - however the physical showed the wrong interfaces.
I think it is due to the design of my routers where in one A and B are on opposite sides than in the other schematic. After correcting that, I added eth2 on Router B as
a passive interface, while having my lubuntu wireshark listening on the physical line LAN4 between the parties mentioned. The <strong>gif</strong> below shows the process.</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/Disablingeth2RouterB.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>After rebooting the router, I do see one hello being registred in wireshark. By looking at the information though, I see that the source IP is router B, but the designated router
IP which previously was 192.168.39.129 - aka eth2, now shows 0.0.0.0 and there are no more packages registred once time goes by.</p>
<p>The two other interfaces on Router B goes to the other routers, and the same goes for Router C. However for Router A - I do have an interface that currently is sending hello packets down
to Network_Switch_B -&gt; and further to the other switches and workgroups connected there. There is no reason to send hellos out that interface, because there is no way we can form an adjacency to the devices from that interface and onwards.</p>
<p>Due to this, I also set eth0 (between router A and Switch B) as passive-interface, in addition to also 0.5, 0.15 and 0.25 which are the VLANS we created in an previous exercise.</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/passiveinterfacesrouterab.png" alt=""></p>
<h1 id="md5-key-authentication-between-routers">MD5 key authentication between routers</h1>
<p>I set one key on the interfaces between router A and B, and another key between the interfaces connecting Routers A and B to router C. I try to add two keys, to keep them separate.
<img src="/images/network-doc/E08/md5keysconfig.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I set the Lubuntu-wireshark VM to listen on the line &ldquo;RoAToRoB&rdquo; between Router A and B.</p>
<p>From the information gained using wireshark, I see new lines within the OSPF fields describing authentication. These update on each hello-packet, and I assume they have the MD5 encryption and not just a conversion. Its been a while since I played around with hashvalues.
I start an attempt to test them with a program called john, vs an example password file i wrote quickly, but initially it fails. Initially I find it hard to use the file gained from the ettercap print, and I notice I did the cut wrong so the values arent easily identified.</p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/wireshark-key.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/images/network-doc/E08/Collectinghashes.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead I copy one of the hashes straight from Wireshark and save that as a textfile routeratobsinglehash.txt, of which the program hashid gives some alternatives. Although since I already know it is MD5, I try that format in John and come up with a couple pretty decent hits from my password list. Its missing a digit in the end, but seeing atleast that the name appeared it seems the MD5 authentication works.

<pre tabindex="0"><code>Notes:
- Last week &#34;switching loops&#34; in OSI L2. Also a phenomenon called &#34;routing loops&#34; on L3. TTL-field in L3-packets helps preventing meltdowns.
- Static routing vs dynamic routing. Instead of creating routes, the router devices broadcast information and listen to information between eachother &#34;adjacencies&#34;. 
- Large scale, distance vector. Distance/direction. Main protocol in this course is called Border Gateway Protocol.
- OSPF Open Shortest Path First. Calculating cost of each route by measuring/taking the metric(calculations) based on links between devices, cable quality, distance and such. 
Djikstra&#39;s algoritmn, which tell the shortest path from _one_ node to every other node. 

- Changing bandwidth reference must be done on all routers. This seems to be quite vital in particularily fast ethernets. By default the reference-bandwidth is 100 Mbits/sec. 
If you then have a 100 Mbits line, it has a cost of 1. Seeing then that you also have a line of 10 Gbit, the cost-value can not be lower than 1, hence it gets registred with the same cost. 
To take advantage of faster speeds, change the reference value. 

Adjacencies between routers are formed through exchange of OSPF -packets. 

Router-ID is the IPv4 address, set by the admin. This so the routers will know who is where/what. If this is not done/forgotten - default is that the highest binary value of the IPv4 addresses of loopback interfaces. 
Lastly if this is not avaliable, the highest IPv4 of other interfaces will be the ID.
